# Greedy algorithms for compressed sensing

### 8.1 Greed, a flexible alternative to convexification



- ##### "greediness"

- ##### RIP

   A satisfies the *restricted isometry property*



1. ##### Greedy pursuits

   Iteratively \estimation \fast

   theoretical performance guarantees are typically weaker than other methods.

2. ##### Thresholding

   Element selection + pruning

   Fast \easy \guarantees



### 8.2 Greedy pursuits

History 

some notions are all closely related yet discovered independently.

 

#### 8.2.1 General framework

##### 2 fundamental steps:

- Element selection

- coeffient update



##### Initialization:

*estimate* $\hat x ^{[0]}=0$ 

*initial residual error* $r^{[0]}=y- \hat x ^{[0]}$
